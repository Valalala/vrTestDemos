<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a collection of small demos to test various ideas and questions I had for things in VR. Warning: some of them can be quite nauseating. The Spiderman demos were the only ones that were expanded upon. The project was tested using a HTC Vive. Created using Unity 2018.1.5 and assets from the asset store. 


## SpiderMan 
Swing on ropes like Spiderman. Point the controller and pull the trigger to shoot a web; hold the trigger to stay attached. Swinging your arms around will pull you in closer to the web connection point. Use this to build up speed, not to get off the ground or to make sudden moves in the air. If you are on the ground clicking the grips will launch you in the direction the controller is pointing. The rotation of the play area is locked, so you must turn yourself to look around. Your "body" is quite large so you will sometimes hit buildings.

Tips: It is best to shoot webs perpindicular to the direction you want to go. Good luck. 

Bugs: if you miss a building when shooting a web, it will still display a line to the last point you connected to. 

## FreeSpiderMan
The same as Spiderman, but now the play area orientates to match the direction you are moving. Start play facing whatever forward is for your play area. I recommend getting confortable rope swinging in Spiderman before trying this.

## IronMan 
Jetpacks thrust in the direction of the controllers.

## WallMan 
Teleporting rotates the play area so that the normal of the teleported to surface is the player's new "up".

## BirdMan
Pulling the trigger reflects your momentum off a plane centered on your controller. Holding the grips sends you upward. Testing instructions:

Hold grips until at a decent height. Wait until you reach the apex of your arc and start falling. Point controller straight down and hold trigger. Slowly angle controller untill it points forward. You should have now entered a steady glide. 

## ThrowMan
Use the trigger to throw an anchor that you are attached to.

## BounceMan
Same as Throwman but with rotation unlocked.

## DashMan 
Throw your head in a direction to be thrown in that direction. Don't hurt yourself.

## WarpMan 
Attempt to mess with the projection matrix of the headset. See [this article](https://medium.com/realities-io/making-the-inception-effect-in-unity-3d-with-few-lines-of-code-fb9667d4786f) for what I was attempting. 

## LargeMan
Attempt to do the miniature planet effect in VR.

## FocusMan 
The idea was to blur everything but the thing you want to draw the player's attention to. This does not do that. This just changes the depth of field effect based on what you are currently looking at.

## ZoomMan 
Testing a zoom effect.

## BackOfHeadMan 
One eye shows what is in front of you, the other shows you what is behind you.
